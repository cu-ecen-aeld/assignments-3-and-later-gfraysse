# 10) Write a shell script finder-app/writer.sh as described below

#     Accepts the following arguments: the first argument is a full path to a file (including filename) on the filesystem, referred to below as writefile; the second argument is a text string which will be written within this file, referred to below as writestr

#     Exits with value 1 error and print statements if any of the arguments above were not specified

#     Creates a new file with name and path writefile with content writestr, overwriting any existing file and creating the path if it doesn’t exist. Exits with value 1 and error print statement if the file could not be created.

# Example:

#        writer.sh /tmp/aesd/assignment1/sample.txt ios

# Creates file:

#     /tmp/aesd/assignment1/sample.txt

#             With content:

#             ios
if [ $# != 2 ]

    echo "Incorrect number of arguments expected 2 got "$#". Usage: finder.sh filesdir searchstr"
    exit 1

#echo creating `dirname $writefile`
